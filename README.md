**Description:**
This repository contains the code for my 3D Semantic Segmentation project using the Unet_VGG19 model. The goal of the project was to perform semantic segmentation on 3D data.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is available at EPFL CVLab Data. Due to licensing and usage restrictions, you will need to download the dataset separately before running the code.

**Model Architecture:**
The Unet_VGG19 model is a U-Net architecture with the VGG19 backbone. It consists of an encoder using the pre-trained VGG19 model for feature extraction and a decoder to produce the final segmentation output.
